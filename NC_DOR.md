# North Carolina Department of Revenue
There are various data from the DOR on [economic variables across the state](http://www.dornc.com/publications/reimbursement.html). An important one for a regional economist is county level month-to-month collection of taxes across North Carolina, which began [in July of 2003](http://www.dornc.com/publications/archive/archive.html). Very cool.

In addition, the DOR collects data on beer, unfortified wine, and unfortified wine starting in April 1, 2002. These are in pdf files from 2003 to 2009, after which excel files are provided. The data are yearly and indicate disbursement across counties and municipalities for the entire state.
>> AMOUNT OF BEER (BEER, LAGER BEER, ALE, PORTER, ETC.)
>> UNFORTIFIED WINE AND FORTIFIED WINE EXCISE TAXES ALLOCATED TO COUNTIES
>> AND MUNICIPALITIES AS REQUIRED BY GENERAL STATUTE 105-113.82
>> FOR THE PERIOD APRIL 1 TO MARCH 31

I have not looked at all of the data yet, but it appears to be a potentially useful source of data for this repository. Concern is there for interpretation of data because there are [county level adjustment factors](http://www.dornc.com/publications/county_adjustment_factor.pdf) that make it so the disbursement across the state is not equal for all.
